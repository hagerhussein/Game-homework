1) I have done the automated test parts in the HTML and JS files that you have provided.
2) I continued section 4 of the homework in a separate folder (my-first-game).
3) I made the separate folder because I wanted the game to look neat without the part of the automated test and also when I added the code in the files that you provided it affected the score of the test.
4) Enjoy the game :) and I am looking forward to hear your feedback.
